# Turn any near account into a community

Do you have a near account that you would like to build a community around?
Now building onchain subaccount stores.
Check out https://web3stick.on-fleek.app/ as an example.

How this works
I have a contract that can be depoyed to any near account that can be deployed to any near account and turn that account into an on chain sub account store.


Becuase the contract is on chain there is no limits the apps that could be build to integrate with your near account. I can build a front end website with a secure web3 near check out that community can use to buy subaccounts.

Why you might want to build a community around your near account?
If you already have a community and a near account, building a community around your near account can bring more value to it. plus every time people see on chain activity from near account with your address in them it brings more awareness to your community.

Why your community might want to buy a near account?
Buying a subaccount of your near account gives them a unique, onchain identity that links them to your community. It's up for you to decide what perks they get.
